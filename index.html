        Among his many achievements, Dr. Houbolt was an avid mathematician, and
        in researching and teaching himself orbital mechanics, he realized that
        the concept of Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR) had far-reaching
        ramifications in space travel. He deemed this idea so important that he
        risked his career promoting the concept of LOR.
